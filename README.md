# Reddit No Frills Dark+

Simple dark theme for Reddit.

Completely revamped version of [itsamoreh/reddit-no-frills](https://github.com/itsamoreh/reddit-no-frills).

Includes sidebar and multireddit chooser.

Sidebar shows up on hover (icon in the top right).

Add code to a usertheme manually or [install with stylish here](https://userstyles.org/styles/133277/reddit-no-frills-dark).

Make sure to turn subreddit styles off in reddit settings:

settings / display / allow subreddits to show me custom themes. 

Let me know if anything needs fixing.

Tested on Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

Not fully RES compatible.
